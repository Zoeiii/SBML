# SBML
o	Using Python ply parser to design my own language with the hybrid functionality of SML and Python<br/>
o	My role of the project is to design context free grammars for parser to call the scanner to get all the tokens need.<br/>
o	After all the necessary grammar rules are defined with Python lex, I then use Python yacc to read all the tokens and perform action. <br/>
