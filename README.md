# SBML
o	Using Python ply parser to design my own language with the hybrid functionality of SML and Python
o	My role of the project is to design context free grammars for parser to call the scanner to get all the tokens need.
o	After all the necessary grammar rules are defined with Python lex, I then use Python yacc to read all the tokens and perform action. 
o	The functionality of SBML including Variables and Assignments, functions, function call, static scope.
  Data types including:
    •	Numbers (integer and float), tuple, List, Sting, Boolean
  Operations: 
    •	+, -, /, mod, div, ::,  < , >, <=, >=, not, andalso, orelse, tuple indexing(#), and list indexing
